# Movie Dataset Cleaning and Analyzing
This repository contains Python code for cleaning and visualizing a movies dataset using pandas library. The dataset is cleaned to remove any inconsistencies and missing values, and then visualizations are created to explore various aspects of the dataset.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a collection of movie data containing information such as title, release year, genre, ratings, etc. The dataset may contain inconsistencies and missing values which are addressed during the cleaning process.

# Cleaning Process
The cleaning process involves:

Handling missing values: Any missing values in the dataset are identified and handled appropriately, either by filling them with suitable values or dropping the rows/columns if necessary.

Data type conversion: Convert data types of columns as necessary to ensure consistency and proper analysis.

Removing duplicates: Remove any duplicate entries in the dataset to avoid redundancy.

Standardizing data: Standardize data formats and values to maintain consistency.

# Analyzing the Dataset
After cleaning the dataset, various visualizations are created to analyze different aspects of the movie data. Some of the visualizations may include:

# Distribution of movie ratings
Trend of movie releases over the years
Genre distribution
Correlation between different attributes such as ratings and revenue

# Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need:

Python 3.x
Pandas library
Numpy library
